[![Godot Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.3-blue)](https://godotengine.org/download/)

This project is my starter that I use to create games in godot (mostly 2D games).

* ci/pushbuild.py - Script to export builds and upload them to itch.io
* addons/toggle-external-editor/ - checkbox to toggle between external editor and godot debugger
* addons/debugdraw2d/ - debug visualization tools

* code/common/ - nodes used in multiple games
* code/util/ - gdscript libraries for common logic
